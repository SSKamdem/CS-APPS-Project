        <h1>My Journey to Milton!</h1>
        <p>I started school in England, at Cheyne's Children's Centre in Chelsea, London. I don't have a picture of me in Pre-K at my disposal right now, but here's some pictures of younger me.</p>

        <p>After my family moved back to Cameroon from England, I continued elementary and then middle school at Dewey International School in Douala, Cameroon, my hometown.I began high school at Enko Bonanjo International School in Douala, then I switched to The Bridge International School. Below are pictures of me with some of my friends from The Bridge at their graduation last summer! (I'm a repeat so they graduated last summer;)</p>
